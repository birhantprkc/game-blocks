## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The local application is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Test

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm e2e
pnpm build
```

## Deployment

Log in to Cloudflare once:

```bash
pnpm exec wrangler login
```

Deploy the production Worker:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

The application does not require runtime environment variables or Worker
secrets. Wrangler uses your local Cloudflare CLI login to deploy; those
credentials must not be added to the Worker configuration or uploaded with
`wrangler secret put`.
